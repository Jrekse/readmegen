# readmegen
This program is designed to prompt the user in the command line with information about the user's project. Then the user inputs are written into a readme.md file with all of the required areas filled out.

# Technology used:
Javascript
node
inquirer

# To start:
node index.js

# Process:
This project was written on two js files, index.js was the first to tackle because it would start the prompts and grab all of the user inputs to be passed to the next file, markdown.js. this file takes the inputs from index.js and writes it to the new readme file.
